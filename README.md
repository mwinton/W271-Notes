# W271-Notes

## Statistical Methods for Discrete Response, Time Series, and Panel Data

These are my notes and sample code from the UC Berkeley MIDS W271 class (summer 2018).

These are derived primarily from Jeff Yau's official async slides and assigned textbooks,
but with more complete code samples. In a few places, I've reorganized topics slightly in
order by have a more intuitive flow (at least to me).  I've also made an attempt to improve
consistency of mathematical notation, as the original async slides frequently have mixed
terminology from different original sources.

All html files are output of the corresponding Rmd files of the same name.  To
run them yourself, you should need to do little more than set your working directory
in RStudio.
